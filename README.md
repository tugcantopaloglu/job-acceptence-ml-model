# Job Acceptance Prediction ML Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a job candidate accepting a job offer based on various features. The goal of the project is to assist recruiters in understanding candidate preferences and optimizing their hiring strategies.

## Features

- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses historical data to predict job acceptance likelihood.
- **Customizable Model**: Easily adaptable to various industries by tweaking the dataset and model parameters.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For code development and demonstration

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tugcantopaloglu/job-acceptence-ml-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd job-acceptence-ml-model
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate the model:
   - Open the terminal and run:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Navigate to the relevant notebook in the `notebooks/` folder and follow the steps.

3. Evaluate predictions:
   - Use the saved model from the `models/` directory to make predictions on new data.

## Example

Here is an example of how to load the trained model and make a prediction:

```python
from src.model_utils import load_model, predict

# Load the model
model = load_model('models/job_acceptance_model.pkl')

# Sample candidate data
candidate_data = {
    'experience_years': 5,
    'education_level': 'Master',
    'expected_salary': 75000,
    'job_location': 'Remote'
}

# Make prediction
prediction = predict(model, candidate_data)
print(f"Job Acceptance Probability: {prediction}")
```
